# password-generator

This is a handy-dandy password generator, useful for creating random passwords with no personal affiliation or connection (thereby much more secure). 

Upon first loading the page will ask how many characters the user would like their custom-generated password to be, then create a password for them per that request. The password will then be displayed to the page for further use!
